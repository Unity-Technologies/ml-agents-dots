# ML-Agents DOTS

This repository is a prototype of a DOTS compatible version of the [ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/python-packages_0.25.0). It uses the [Data Oriented Tech Stack (DOTS)](https://unity.com/dots) of Unity.
Note that not all features of ML-Agents are supported. For example, it is not possible to use imitation learning or cooperative/adversarial behaviors yet. The API of the DOTS version is different from the ML-Agents API in the Editor, it is the responsibility of the user to update the observations of the Agents since there are no implementation of sensors.
For more information about the API please see the [Documentation](./Documentation~/README.md).
